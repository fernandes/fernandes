### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to work with web development, being more specific, since 2010 when I got in touch with Ruby and then Rails, it was love at first sight. Since then, I've enjoyed countless hours working with this fantastic technology. The only missing part was the frontend, and when I discovered React in 2017, it was a match made in heaven.

That's how I've been working past few years, with Ruby/Rails and JS/React; some other support services I love to work with are also Postgres, Redis, Kafka, and Elasticsearch, my professional level of experience is 10+ years with the psql/Redis, and two years with Kafka and Elasticsearch.

I started my career as a sysadmin back in 2005, managing servers for a real estate company, and as more as I got involved with web development, I fell in love and focused even more on it. Given this background, performance is one of my main topics of interest. My hobby is filling the gap between web and systems programming, achieving outstanding performance, and low usage of resources.

That's why I have my _performance stack_, the one is I love to play with, and it is composed by:

- [Crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal), an outstanding programming language, slick as ruby, fast as C
- [Lucky Framework](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky), if it's web development and crystal, then the answer is Lucky
- [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) is my first choice for doing any frontend work. [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) is AMAZING; I felt joy doing frontend work like I haven't felt in a long time.
- [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), if something _react like_ is needed, why not preact?! I love its simplicity and performance.
- [Postgres](https://github.com/postgres/postgres), after all these years, is a fantastic database. Geospatial ([Postgis](https://github.com/postgis/postgis)), time-series data ([Timescale](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb)), its extensions are icy in the cake.
- [Redpanda](https://github.com/vectorizedio/redpanda), a drop-in replacement for Kafka, is developed using Seastar Framework. Beautiful architecture, performance, and simplicity. I wish all software were made that way.

Now you know me a little bit more, let's talk about web development?
